I've been working on quite a few projects recently, most of them being lua scriptmods for gearblocks.
The libraries i've promised are slowly being worked on indivdually as i work on those projects, and i feel like i'll be comfortable to release a lot of this code soon.
I've been having problems with a lack of intellisense and code hinting when working with the libraries, but it seems that it's been an issue with the actual extenstion i was using.
[here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) is the extenstion for Visual Studio Code that I just found to work, and that i will be devloping for.
The libraries still lack a lot of defitions for the globals, but with this extenstion, I seem to be able to make those without making you include
